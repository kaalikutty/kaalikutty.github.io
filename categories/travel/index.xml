      <description>Lima, the capital of Peru. When I first told my Mom about my onsite travel plan to Peru, she was frightened. For her, its a country where people get kidnapped, robbed, murdered and I know its no one but my brother scared her. First foreign trip, it was a dream from childhood to explore many places. But of course, being a woman, the world has a lot of restrictions defined. Finally, the day came Oct 13 -2018 and I flew to Lima.</description>
