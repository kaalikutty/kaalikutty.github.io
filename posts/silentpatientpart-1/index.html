      <article style="margin-top: 2rem;"><p>Started my reading taste with Novoneel Chakraborty&rsquo;s <strong>&lsquo;&lsquo;The Stranger Trilogy&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
<p>There were days which I have taken off from my work and spend those days to finish the book series. Addicted! Heartbroken! Excited!Thrilled! &hellip;. a lot of mixed feelings. It took many weeks to recover from the hangover of reading such a long series. Lots of work to do, lots of things to do at home, eventually I stopped reading other books of interest. Taken 2 years of a break to finally find a book like &ldquo;The Silent Patient&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Few months after joining my new Company, I attended a Time Management Session.
Dinesh, Training Specialist, he has his own special way of making the session interesting. To be honest, in fact, his sessions are the best. Fun, Activities, it goes like that. Before finishing the session, I really don&rsquo;t remember what insisted him to suggest this book (The Silent Patient). Just for the sake of the session, I noted the name on my notepad. The session is over, work is over for the day, back home.</p>
<p>Searched for the book and somehow I couldn&rsquo;t found the pdf document. After the session, I was talking to my Colleague Kushal and shared him the view that &lsquo;The Silent Patient&rsquo; is an interesting book, How stupid I am, haven&rsquo;t read that but still was too confident to tell him ðŸ˜‚. After a few days, he shared the pdf of the book through my WhatsApp.I felt so excited to read. Read four-five pages, and felt very tired or bored. It&rsquo;s not because the story is bad, its because I am tired after this many hours of work in front of my laptop and then again reading this pdf on my mobile was not at all comfortable. Eyes were burning. Just left it as it is in my downloads.</p>
<p>There comes the COVID-19 days&hellip;</p>
<p>Feb 29, 2020, My third-time travel to Slough, UK.2 weeks onsite at  O2 office. Busy days with the meeting, work, and corona cases started spreading London and eventually one or two cases on the slough too. India started blocking Visa from many countries, Airport lock was about to start. Terrified, I wanted to go back. After a lot of approvals and finally, back to India.14 days of quarantine, there comes the complete lockdown. Its been 4 months at just home, just at home. I started forgetting days of online shopping for dresses. Wake up in the morning, prepare breakfast, lunch, and then sit for around 10-11 hours of work. That&rsquo;s it. Trust me that was all about the COVID days. I felt so bad day by day. Why am I spending all my time just for work and food? I wanted to do something else. Just a random thought comes through my mind.BOOK.Opened Amazon, searched for some thrillers. The first name came in the search &ldquo;The Silent Patient&rdquo;.Yes, I must buy this. Certain times it has gone through my mind to read the pdf but my tiredness never allowed me to do so. Its time for a loyal friend, to survive the COVID times let&rsquo;s get engaged with more and more things. Ordered, finally, it reaches my hand.</p>
