      <description>COVID-19 4 months, Its been 4months, living my life Scared of you... You wiped out many lives from this world You pulled down many lives in this world Every call from my parents makes me nervous Every day thinking about you, that one day you will grab me too with your hands Many beautiful lives give up without even saying a bye to their loved ones. They give up without even seeing their kids.</description>
