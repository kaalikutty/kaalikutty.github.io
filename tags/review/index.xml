      <description>Started my reading taste with Novoneel Chakraborty&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;The Stranger Trilogy&amp;rdquo;.
There were days which I have taken off from my work and spend those days to finish the book series. Addicted! Heartbroken! Excited!Thrilled! &amp;hellip;. a lot of mixed feelings. It took many weeks to recover from the hangover of reading such a long series. Lots of work to do, lots of things to do at home, eventually I stopped reading other books of interest.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any idea even after reading about Alcestis. What could be the reason when a woman decided to be silent? Many !.Because a woman is a mystery. She remains silent for many reasons. She might be destroyed inside or she might be waiting to explode or she might be&amp;hellip;..who can explain. Nobody!
She surrenders her life to her husband. She was an ideal of how women love her husband.</description>
